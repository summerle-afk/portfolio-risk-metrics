# Portfolio Risk Metrics

This project analyzes a simple 3-stock portfolio (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon) to demonstrate
fundamental risk and return concepts used in quantitative finance.

## Overview
- Built a portfolio with weights: AAPL (40%), MSFT (30%), AMZN (30%)
- Calculated **daily returns** from stock price data
- Computed **portfolio returns** using weighted averages
- Analyzed **cumulative portfolio growth** starting with a $1 investment
- Measured **risk-adjusted performance** using:
  - Annualized Return
  - Annualized Volatility
  - Sharpe Ratio

- Annual Return:  0.3146
- Volatility:  0.1894
- Sharpe Ratio:  1.3968

## Why This Matters
Portfolio analysis is not only about **how much return** was achieved, but also about  
**how much risk was taken to get that return**.  
This project shows that I understand both **return** and **risk-adjusted performance**,  
which are central concepts in risk management and quantitative finance.
